Note:	The law relating to legal professional privilege is not affected by this Act (see section 242).

(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), the proceedings are:

(a)	a proceeding in a court; or

(b)	a proceeding or hearing before, or an examination by or before, a tribunal in Australia or any other body, authority or person in Australia having power, by law or by consent of parties, to hear, receive or examine evidence;

whether the proceeding, hearing or examination is of a civil, administrative, criminal, disciplinary or other nature.

(3)	Subsection (1) applies in relation to a proceeding against a person even if it is heard together with a proceeding against another person.

(4)	If a written record of an examination of a person is signed by the person under subsection 172G(2) or authenticated in any other manner specified in the AML/CTF Rules, the record is, in a proceeding, prima facie evidence of the statements it records, but nothing in this Division limits or affects the admissibility in the proceeding of other evidence of statements made at the examination.

172M  Statements made at an examination—other proceedings

(1)	If direct evidence by a person (the absent witness) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding referred to in subsection (2), a statement that the absent witness made at an examination under this Division of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter:

(a)	if it appears to the court or tribunal that:

(i)	the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or

(ii)	the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure the witness’ attendance; or

(iii)	all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but the witness cannot be found; or

(b)	if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal—unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.

(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), the proceedings are:

(a)	a proceeding in a court; or

(b)	a proceeding or hearing before, or an examination by or before, a tribunal in Australia or any other body, authority or person in Australia having power, by law or by consent of parties, to hear, receive or examine evidence;

whether the proceeding, hearing or examination is of a civil, administrative, criminal, disciplinary or other nature.

172N  Weight of evidence admitted under section 172M

(1)	This section applies if evidence of a statement made by a person at an examination under this Division of the person is admitted under section 172M in a proceeding.

(2)	In deciding how much weight (if any) to give to the statement as evidence of a matter, regard is to be had to:

(a)	how long after the matters to which it related the statement was made; and

(b)	any reason the person may have had for concealing or misrepresenting a material matter; and

(c)	any other circumstances from which it is reasonable to draw an inference about how accurate the statement is.

(3)	If the person is not called as a witness in the proceeding:

(a)	evidence that would, if the person had been so called, have been admissible in the proceeding for the purpose of destroying or supporting the person’s credibility is so admissible; and

(b)	evidence is admissible to show that the statement is inconsistent with another statement that the person has made at any time.

(4)	However, evidence of a matter is not admissible under this section if, had the person been called as a witness in the proceeding and denied the matter in cross-examination, evidence of the matter would not have been admissible if adduced by the cross-examining party.

172P  Objection to admission of statements made at examination

(1)	A party (the adducing party) to a proceeding referred to in subsection (2) may, not less than 14 days before the first day of the hearing of the proceeding, give to another party to the proceeding written notice that the adducing party:

whether the proceeding, hearing or examination is of a civil, administrative, criminal, disciplinary or other nature.

(3)	A notice under subsection (1) must set out, or be accompanied by writing that sets out, the specified statements.

(4)	Within 14 days after a notice is given under subsection (1), the other party may give to the adducing party a written notice:

(a)	stating that the other party objects to specified statements being admitted in evidence in the proceeding; and

(b)	specifies, in relation to each of those statements, the grounds of objection.

(5)	The period prescribed by subsection (4) may be extended by the court or tribunal or by agreement between the parties concerned.

(6)	On receiving a notice given under subsection (4), the adducing party must give to the court or tribunal or other body referred to in paragraph (2)(b) (as the case requires) a copy of:

(a)	the notice under subsection (1) and any writing that subsection (3) required to accompany that notice; and

(b)	the notice under subsection (4).

(7)	If subsection (6) is complied with, the court or tribunal or other body may either:

Legislation history and amendment history—Endnotes 3 and 4

Amending laws are annotated in the legislation history and amendment history.

The legislation history in endnote 3 provides information about each law that has amended (or will amend) the compiled law. The information includes commencement details for amending laws and details of any application, saving or transitional provisions that are not included in this compilation.

The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law.

Editorial changes

The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date.

If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.

Misdescribed amendments

A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003.

If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and “(md not incorp)” is added to the amendment history.
