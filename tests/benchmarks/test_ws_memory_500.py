"""WebSocket Memory Integration Test — 500 interactions with date-spaced history.

Strategy:
1. Pre-seed the message DB with ~200 messages across 30+ past dates
   (simulating a real user with months of conversation history)
2. Run 500 WS interactions through /ws/conversation
3. Validate recall accuracy, tool usage, protocol compliance, temporal reasoning

Date distribution for pre-seeded data:
  - 90 days ago: 20 messages (early facts, old job, old city)
  - 60 days ago: 25 messages (mid-period facts, preferences)
  - 30 days ago: 30 messages (recent facts, some updates)
  - 14 days ago: 25 messages (recent updates)
  - 7 days ago: 20 messages (very recent)
  - 3 days ago: 15 messages (latest context)
  - Today: 500 live WS interactions

Usage:
    uv run ea http &
    uv run python tests/benchmarks/test_ws_memory_500.py
