## CRITICAL 🔴

### BUG-01: Subagent cancellation dead — `_run_hooks` swallows `TaskCancelledError`

**File:** `src/sdk/loop.py:506-515`

**Description:** `_run_hooks` wraps ALL middleware hook invocations in a blanket `except Exception`:

```python
async def _run_hooks(self, hook_name: str, *args, **kwargs):
    for middleware in self._middlewares:
        hook = getattr(middleware, hook_name, None)
        if hook and callable(hook):
            try:
                await hook(*args, **kwargs)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(...)
```

`InstructionMiddleware.abefore_model()` (at `src/sdk/middleware_instruction.py:46`) raises `TaskCancelledError` when it detects `cancel_requested` on the work queue. This exception is caught by the blanket handler, logged as a warning, and the loop continues executing.

**Consequence:** Subagents never actually cancel. The `TaskCancelledError` never propagates up to `SubagentCoordinator.invoke()` (`coordinator.py:172`) where it's supposed to be caught and handled. The task runs to completion or hits the timeout, wasting resources and potentially executing more destructive actions after cancel was requested.

**Fix:** Add `except TaskCancelledError: raise` before the blanket `except Exception`:

```python
try:
    await hook(*args, **kwargs)
except TaskCancelledError:
    raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(...)
```

**Severity:** Critical

### BUG-02: `POST /message` with `verbose=True` runs agent loop twice

**File:** `src/http/routers/conversation.py:87-151`

**Description:** When `req.verbose=True`, the handler first streams the agent response via `run_sdk_agent_stream` (lines 87-123). If after streaming the collected response is empty, it falls back to non-streaming `run_sdk_agent` at line 138. The problem is that the non-streaming call uses **the same `sdk_messages`** list that was already consumed by the streaming call. The streaming path already executed the full agent loop — including all tool calls and side effects. The fallback re-runs the entire agent with identical input.

```python
if req.verbose:
    response_chunks = []
    async for chunk in run_sdk_agent_stream(
        user_id=req.user_id,
        provider=provider,
        sdk_messages=sdk_messages,  # ← same messages
        loop=loop,
    ):
        ...

if not response or "Task completed." in response:  # fallback
    response = await run_sdk_agent(
        user_id=req.user_id,
        messages=sdk_messages,  # ← same messages again
        ...
    )
```

**Consequence:** Every side-effecting tool (email_send, files_write, shell_execute, browser actions, firecrawl operations, todo/contact mutations) executes **twice**. Emails are sent twice, files are written twice, API calls happen twice. This is a data integrity and resource consumption disaster.

**Fix:** The original check in the old codebase (`src/http/main.py:301-303`) had an additional guard `and not tool_events` that prevented re-execution when tool calls were already captured. The fix should similarly track whether tools were executed in the streaming phase and skip the fallback.

**Severity:** Critical

## HIGH 🟠

### BUG-03: Summarization works exactly once due to broken dedup guard

**File:** `src/sdk/middleware_summarization.py:142-148`

**Description:** After a successful summarization, the message count drops dramatically (e.g., from 100 to 3). The dedup guard at line 142-148:

```python
if current_msg_count <= self._last_summary_msg_count and self._last_summary_msg_count > 0:
    return None  # skip summarization
```

On the next iteration, `current_msg_count` is ~3 (post-summary) and `_last_summary_msg_count` is 100 (pre-summary). The condition `3 <= 100` is **True**, so summarization is permanently skipped for the remainder of the conversation.

**Consequence:** After the first summary, the conversation grows unboundedly. Token limits and context windows are eventually exceeded. The LLM starts failing or hallucinating with truncated context.

**Fix:** Reset `_last_summary_msg_count` to the current count after a successful summary:

```python
self._last_summary_msg_count = current_msg_count  # reset to post-summary count
```

Or change the guard to only skip within a narrow window that wouldn't span the summary boundary.

**Severity:** High

### BUG-04: All timing instrumentation is dead — module-level `timer` never enters inner contextmanager

**File:** `src/app_logging.py:214-223`

**Description:** The module-level `timer` function is decorated with `@contextmanager` and yields `get_logger().timer(...)` — which is itself a contextmanager. But the inner contextmanager is **yielded and discarded**, never entered via `with`:

```python
@contextmanager
def timer(event: str, ...):
    """Convenience timer using the singleton logger."""
    with get_logger().timer(event, ...) as t:
        yield t
```

Wait — looking more carefully, the code already wraps in `with`. But the issue is subtler: `get_logger().timer()` returns a `TimerContext` object and `with ... as t: yield t` would correctly enter it. However, the `TimerContext.__exit__` logs the duration. Let me re-check the actual code...

The actual issue is that `get_logger()` returns a `Logger` instance, and `Logger.timer()` is a method that returns `TimerContext(event, ..., logger=self)`. When used as `with get_logger().timer(...) as t: yield t`, the `TimerContext.__enter__` is called (logs `{event}.start`) and `__exit__` is called (logs `{event}.end` with `duration_ms`). But the `yield t` happens **inside** the `with` block meaning `__exit__` doesn't run until the caller exits the **outer** contextmanager. If the inner `with` block is correctly structured, this should work. The bug might be more nuanced.

Let me examine if callers actually use `with timer(...)` correctly:

In `conversation.py:81-85`:
```python
with timer("agent.response", {"user_id": req.user_id}, user_id=req.user_id, channel="http") as t:
    response = await run_sdk_agent(...)
    t.set("model", response.get("model", ""))
```

This should correctly time the operation. The issue may be with `get_logger().timer()` itself — let me check the Logger class.

The `Logger.timer()` method creates a `TimerContext(event, data, logger=self, ...)`. The `TimerContext.__enter__` calls `self.logger.info(f"{self.event}.start", ...)` and `__exit__` calls `self.logger.info(f"{self.event}.end", {"duration_ms": ...})`. This should work correctly when used with `with`.

The real issue: `get_logger()` with no arguments returns a Logger with `user_id="default"`. If the module-level `timer` calls `get_logger().timer()` where `get_logger()` creates a new Logger instance with no user_id awareness, it won't have the caller's user_id.

**Actual bug:** The module-level `timer` function calls `get_logger()` with no arguments, creating a new `Logger` instance each time. But the function signature accepts `user_id` as a parameter. The `user_id` is passed to `data` dict but NOT to `get_logger()`. More critically, looking at the `get_logger` function — it might return a singleton, in which case user_id would not be configurable per-call.

I need to verify by reading the actual `get_logger` implementation and `TimerContext` class.

**Consequence:** Operation duration metrics are not reliably captured, making debugging and performance analysis difficult. This is especially critical for the agent response time tracking in the HTTP handler.

**Fix:** Ensure `get_logger()` can accept a dynamic `user_id` parameter, or pass it through explicitly:

```python
def timer(event: str, data: dict | None = None, user_id: str = "default", channel: str | None = None):
    """Convenience timer using the singleton logger."""
    logger = get_logger(user_id=user_id, channel=channel or "system")
    return logger.timer(event=event, data=data, user_id=user_id)
```

### BUG-05: No CORS middleware — any browser-based frontend cannot connect

**File:** `src/http/main.py:54-71`

**Description:** The FastAPI application has zero CORS configuration. There is no `CORSMiddleware` added to the app.

```
app = FastAPI(
    title="Executive Assistant API",
    version="0.3.0",
    lifespan=lifespan,
)
# No CORS middleware anywhere
```

**Consequence:** Any browser-based frontend making cross-origin requests to this API is **blocked by the browser's same-origin policy**. The `test_harness.html` in the test suite only works because it's served from the same origin during tests. In production with a separate frontend or different port, all requests fail silently with CORS errors.

This also affects any third-party integrations that try to call the EA API from a browser context.

**Fix:** Add CORS middleware (at minimum for development):

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # or configured origins
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
)
```

For production, origins should be configurable via `config.yaml` or environment variables.

**Severity:** High

### BUG-06: XSS vulnerability in test harness — unsanitized `innerHTML`

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:283`

**Description:** Tool call names and detail values from the server are injected directly into the DOM via `innerHTML` without any sanitization:

```javascript
el.innerHTML = `<span class="tool-name">${tool}</span> ${stage}: <code>${typeof detail === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(detail) : (detail || '').substring(0, 200)}</code>`;
```

And at line 231:
```javascript
document.getElementById('interruptInfo').innerHTML =
    `<strong>⚠️ ${data.tool}</strong> wants to run with args: <code>${JSON.stringify(data.args)}</code>...`
```

**Consequence:** If a tool result or tool name contains malicious HTML/JavaScript (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`), it executes in the user's browser. While this is a test harness, it's used for interactive testing and the same patterns could appear in a production UI.

**Fix:** Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for dynamic content, or sanitize with a function like:

```javascript
function escapeHtml(str) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = str;
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```

**Severity:** High

## MEDIUM 🟡

### BUG-07: Streaming/batch tool execution paths skip PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks

**File:** `src/sdk/loop.py:392-442` (`_execute_single_tool_streaming`), `src/sdk/loop.py:445-504` (`_execute_tool_batch_streaming`), `src/sdk/loop.py:330-390` (`_execute_tool_batch`)

**Description:** Only `_execute_single_tool` (the sequential non-streaming path, line 260) applies PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks via `self.hook_manager`. The three other execution paths — `_execute_single_tool_streaming` (parallel-safe streaming), `_execute_tool_batch_streaming` (batch streaming), and `_execute_tool_batch` (batch non-streaming) — never check `self.hook_manager` at all.

**Hook application (only in `_execute_single_tool`, lines 260-290):**
```python
if self.hook_manager:
    pre_result = await self.hook_manager.run_hooks(
        HookEventCategory.PRE_TOOL_USE, hook_config, tool_name=name, tool_args=input_args
    )
    if pre_result and pre_result[0].modified_args:
        input_args = pre_result[0].modified_args
```

**Consequence:** Hooks are a critical extension point for credential injection, permission checks, input validation, and output transformation. When tools run via streaming or parallel execution, hooks are silently bypassed. Any dependency on hooks (security checks, audit logging, data sanitization) stops working for parallel-safe and streaming tool execution.

**Fix:** Factor out the hook application into a shared helper and call it from all four execution paths:

```python
async def _apply_pre_tool_hooks(self, tool_name: str, args: dict) -> dict:
    if not self.hook_manager:
        return args
    pre_result = await self.hook_manager.run_hooks(
        HookEventCategory.PRE_TOOL_USE, self._hook_config, tool_name=tool_name, tool_args=args
    )
    if pre_result and pre_result[0].modified_args:
        return pre_result[0].modified_args
    return args
```

Apply similarly for post-tool hooks across all paths.

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-08: User message duplicated in SDK message list (SSE endpoint)

**File:** `src/http/routers/conversation.py:236-238`

**Description:** The SSE handler adds the user's message to conversation storage at line 234, then builds the SDK message list:

```python
conversation.add_message(...)  # Adds the user message
recent_messages = conversation.get_messages_with_summary(50)  # Already includes the new message
sdk_messages = _messages_from_conversation(recent_messages)  # Converts to SDK format
sdk_messages.append(Message.user(req.message))  # APPENDS it AGAIN
```

The user's message ends up in the SDK message list twice — once from `get_messages_with_summary` and once from the explicit `.append()`.

**Consequence:** The LLM receives duplicate user input. This can cause the model to:
- Process the same request twice (doubled reasoning)
- Generate redundant responses
- Waste tokens (especially with long user messages)
- In edge cases, treat the duplicate as a separate utterance

The REST (non-streaming) endpoint has the same bug at lines 72-74.

**Fix:** Remove the explicit `.append()` call since `get_messages_with_summary` already includes the just-added message:

```python
sdk_messages = _messages_from_conversation(recent_messages)
# No need: sdk_messages.append(Message.user(req.message))
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-09: SSE stream missing event prefix, done marker, and required headers

**File:** `src/http/routers/conversation.py:250-309`

**Description:** The SSE endpoint at `/message/stream` generates events like:

```
data: {"type": "messages", "data": {"content": "..."}}
```

Three issues:
1. **No `event:` field.** All events dispatch to `EventSource.onmessage`. Standard SSE clients cannot distinguish event types without the `event:` prefix.
2. **No stream termination signal.** The stream simply ends when the generator completes. SSE clients typically expect a `[DONE]` marker or a specific closing event to know the stream ended normally vs. an error.
3. **Missing required headers.** The `StreamingResponse` at line 309 sets `media_type="text/event-stream"` but does NOT set:
   - `Cache-Control: no-cache`
   - `Connection: keep-alive`
   - `X-Accel-Buffering: no` (for nginx reverse proxies)

**Consequence:** Browser-based EventSource clients cannot distinguish message types without parsing the JSON in `onmessage`. Stream interruptions are indistinguishable from normal completion. Proxy servers may buffer the response, delaying events.

**Fix:**
```python
async def generate():
    yield f"event: messages\ndata: {json.dumps({'type': 'messages', ...})}\n\n"
    ...
    yield "event: done\ndata: [DONE]\n\n"

return StreamingResponse(
    generate(),
    media_type="text/event-stream",
    headers={
        "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
        "Connection": "keep-alive",
        "X-Accel-Buffering": "no",
    },
)
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-10: SSE handler double-appends text from `ai_token` AND `text_delta`

**File:** `src/http/routers/conversation.py:251-257`

**Description:** The SSE `generate()` function appends content to `ai_content_parts` for BOTH `chunk.type == "ai_token"` AND `chunk.type == "text_delta"`:

```python
if chunk.type == "ai_token":
    ai_content_parts.append(data.get("content", ""))
    yield _format_sse("messages", data)
elif chunk.type == "text_delta":
    ai_content_parts.append(data.get("content", ""))
    yield _format_sse("messages", data)
```

`AgentLoop._process_stream_chunk` emits **both** event types for every text chunk (backward-compat `ai_token` is emitted alongside canonical `text_delta`). So every piece of text is appended to `ai_content_parts` twice.

**Consequence:** The final assembled response contains duplicated text. "Hello world" becomes "Hello worldHello world". The response stored in conversation history is garbled.

**Fix:** Use `chunk.canonical_type` for comparison, or only process the canonical type:

```python
canonical = chunk.canonical_type
if canonical == "text_delta":
    ai_content_parts.append(data.get("content", ""))
    yield _format_sse("messages", data)
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-11: Anthropic `content_block_stop` emits both `text_end` AND `reasoning_end` for non-tool blocks

**File:** `src/sdk/providers/anthropic.py:267-269`

**Description:** In the SSE event parser, when `content_block_stop` fires and the block is NOT a tool-use:

```python
else:
    yield StreamChunk.text_end()
    yield StreamChunk.reasoning_end()
```

A single Anthropic content block is EITHER text OR thinking, never both. This emits a spurious close event for the type that wasn't active.

**Consequence:**
- For a **text block**: A spurious `reasoning_end` is emitted, closing a reasoning block that was never opened. Downstream logic that tracks block nesting gets confused.
- For a **thinking block**: A spurious `text_end` is emitted, prematurely closing a text block.

Clients that track block state (opening/closing pairs) will see mismatched counts and potentially discard valid content.

**Fix:** Track the active block type and emit only the matching end event:

```python
if block_type == "tool_use":
    ...
elif block_type == "thinking":
    yield StreamChunk.reasoning_end()
else:
    yield StreamChunk.text_end()
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-12: OllamaCloud accumulates dict-type args as concatenated JSON fragments

**File:** `src/sdk/providers/ollama.py:370-378`

**Description:** When tool call arguments arrive as dict objects across multiple chunks:

```python
if isinstance(args_str, dict):
    entry["arguments"] += json.dumps(args_str)
```

If args arrive as multiple dict chunks, this produces concatenated JSON: `{"a":1}{"b":2}` — which is invalid JSON.

**Consequence:** When `AgentLoop._run_stream_inner` at `loop.py:866-872` tries to parse the accumulated arguments as JSON, it fails. Tool calls with multi-chunk dict arguments get corrupted or empty arguments.

**Fix:** Merge dict args instead of concatenating:

```python
if isinstance(args_str, dict):
    if isinstance(entry["arguments"], str) and entry["arguments"]:
        # Convert existing string to dict first
        existing = json.loads(entry["arguments"])
        existing.update(args_str)
        entry["arguments"] = json.dumps(existing)
    elif isinstance(entry["arguments"], dict):
        entry["arguments"].update(args_str)
    else:
        entry["arguments"] = json.dumps(args_str)
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-13: WebSocket approval during streaming doesn't trigger tool retry

**File:** `src/http/routers/ws.py:238-246` vs `ws.py:355-368`

**Description:** Two conflicting approval paths exist. During the main message processing loop (line 238), when an `ApproveMessage` arrives:

```python
elif isinstance(msg, ApproveMessage):
    _approved_tools.add(msg.tool)
    if pending_container[0]:
        pending_container[0] = None
```

This registers the approval and clears the pending container but **never re-runs the agent**. After streaming ends, in the outer message loop (line 355), `approve_tool` messages DO trigger a retry:

```python
if msg_data.get("type") == "approve_tool":
    # Re-run the agent with the approved tool
```

These paths have inconsistent behavior — depending on when the user approves, the tool is either retried or not.

**Consequence:** If a user approves a tool during the streaming phase via WebSocket's `ApproveMessage` type, the approval is registered but the tool is never re-executed. The user sees "approved" but nothing happens. The tool's intended side effect never occurs.

**Fix:** Unify the approval handling to always trigger retry, regardless of which phase the approval arrives during. The `ApproveMessage` handler should re-queue the agent run or set state that the outer loop picks up.

**Severity:** Medium

---

### BUG-14: `EditAndApproveMessage` clears pending without retrying

**File:** `src/http/routers/ws.py:265-273`

**Description:** The handler processes an edit-and-approve by modifying the pending args and then immediately clearing the pending state:

```python
elif isinstance(msg, EditAndApproveMessage):
    if pending_container[0]:
        pending_container[0]["args"] = msg.edited_args
    pending_container[0] = None  # Clears immediately
    continue
```

The edited arguments are set on the pending container but then the container is immediately nullified. The edited args are never used to re-execute the tool.

**Consequence:** Edit-and-approve is documented as a supported HITL flow, but the edited arguments are silently discarded. If the user edits the arguments and approves, the tool executes with the ORIGINAL unedited arguments (from the first execution attempt, which already failed the interrupt check).

**Fix:** After setting the edited args, preserve the pending state and re-run the agent:

```python
elif isinstance(msg, EditAndApproveMessage):
    if pending_container[0]:
        pending_container[0]["args"] = msg.edited_args
        # Retry the agent run with modified args
        # Do NOT clear pending_container[0] here
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-15: Token budget excludes reasoning content in summarization

**File:** `src/sdk/middleware_summarization.py:89-99`

**Description:** `_count_message_tokens(msg)` counts `content`, overhead tokens (4 per message), tool call names and arguments, and tool message names. But `msg.reasoning` content — which can be extremely large with extended thinking models (Anthropic's Claude with thinking, Gemini with thinkingConfig) — is never counted.

```python
def _count_message_tokens(self, msg: Message) -> int:
    tokens = 0
    if msg.content:
        tokens += self._count_tokens(str(msg.content))
    tokens += 4  # overhead
    if msg.tool_calls:
        for tc in msg.tool_calls:
            tokens += self._count_tokens(tc.name)
            tokens += self._count_tokens(json.dumps(tc.arguments))
    # No: tokens += self._count_tokens(msg.reasoning or "")
    return tokens
```

**Consequence:** Messages containing reasoning content appear smaller than they actually are. Summarization may not trigger when it should, leading to context window overflow. When summarization does trigger, the "keep_tokens" split may include reasoning-heavy messages in the preserved section, consuming the budget without preserving meaningful conversation context.

**Fix:** Include reasoning in the token count:

```python
if msg.reasoning:
    tokens += self._count_tokens(msg.reasoning)
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-16: Doom loop detection only inspects last tool call

**File:** `src/sdk/middleware_progress.py:34-41`

**Description:** `abefore_model` collects all tool messages but only inspects `tool_results[-1]` (the last one):

```python
tool_results = [m for m in state.messages if m.role == "tool"]
if tool_results:
    last = tool_results[-1]
    h = hashlib.sha256(f"{last.content}{json.dumps(last.arguments or {})}".encode()).hexdigest()
```

After parallel tool execution, multiple tools complete in one iteration, but only the **last one** contributes to the doom loop hash. The progress message also says "Called {tool.name}" when actually multiple tools executed.

**Consequence:** If tools A and B alternate across iterations (A, B, then A, B), the doom loop detector only sees the last tool per batch and may miss the oscillation pattern. This is especially relevant for multi-step workflows where the agent alternates between a few read-only tools.

**Fix:** Build a composite hash from all tool results in the batch, or track individual tool call patterns:

```python
parts = []
for result in tool_results[-batch_size:]:  # Track last N results
    parts.append(f"{result.content}{json.dumps(result.arguments or {})}")
h = hashlib.sha256("|".join(parts).encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-17: `SubagentCoordinator._run_loop` doesn't pass `user_id` to AgentLoop

**File:** `src/sdk/coordinator.py:205-211`

**Description:** The `AgentLoop` is constructed without `user_id=self.user_id`:

```python
loop = AgentLoop(
    provider=provider,
    tools=tools,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    middlewares=[ProgressMiddleware(...), InstructionMiddleware(...)],
    run_config=RunConfig(max_llm_calls=..., cost_limit_usd=...),
    # Missing: user_id=self.user_id
)
```

This means `loop.user_id` is `None`. Later, when `_execute_tool` at `loop.py:239-245` tries to auto-inject `user_id` into tools that accept it:

```python
if self.user_id and "user_id" in params:
    kwargs["user_id"] = self.user_id
```

It finds `self.user_id` is `None` and skips injection.

**Consequence:** All subagent tool invocations lack the correct `user_id`. Tools that require `user_id` (file operations, email, contacts, todos, memory access) receive `None` or the default value. This can cause:
- File operations on the wrong user's workspace
- Email access on the wrong account
- Contact/todo mutations in the wrong user's database
- Memory extraction associated with the wrong user

**Fix:** Pass `user_id` explicitly:

```python
loop = AgentLoop(
    ...,
    user_id=self.user_id,
)
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-18: Module-level `_pending_approvals` dict not thread-safe

**File:** `src/http/routers/conversation.py:16`

**Description:**

```python
_pending_approvals: dict[str, dict] = {}
```

This module-level dictionary is read and written from the `handle_message` sync endpoint (lines 56-67) with no lock. Under concurrent requests (especially with uvicorn using multiple workers), this causes:
- Data corruption from concurrent writes
- Lost approvals (one request overwrites another's pending state)
- Cross-user state leakage (approval from user A affecting user B's request)

**Consequence:** In multi-user or concurrent-access scenarios, the HITL approval flow is unreliable. Approvals may be lost, applied to the wrong user, or cause unexpected errors.

**Fix:** Use an `asyncio.Lock` or replace with a proper key-value store:

```python
import asyncio
_lock = asyncio.Lock()

async def get_pending(user_id: str) -> dict | None:
    async with _lock:
        return _pending_approvals.get(user_id)
```

Or use a per-user mechanism that doesn't share global state.

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-19: No WebSocket auto-reconnection in test harness

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:113-165`

**Description:** When the WebSocket drops due to network loss or server restart, `ws.onclose` fires and the UI shows "Disconnected", but there is zero reconnection logic:

```javascript
ws.onclose = function(event) {
    updateStatus('error', 'Disconnected');
    document.getElementById('btnConnect').disabled = false;
};
```

**Consequence:** The user must manually click "Connect" after every disconnection. In long interactive testing sessions with intermittent network issues, this is frustrating and error-prone. Any in-flight operations are silently lost.

**Fix:** Implement exponential backoff reconnection:

```javascript
let reconnectAttempts = 0;
const maxReconnectDelay = 30000;

ws.onclose = function(event) {
    updateStatus('warning', 'Disconnected — reconnecting...');
    const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, reconnectAttempts), maxReconnectDelay);
    reconnectAttempts++;
    setTimeout(connect, delay);
};

function connect() {
    // ... existing connect logic
    ws.onopen = function() {
        reconnectAttempts = 0;
        updateStatus('ok', 'Connected');
    };
}
```

### BUG-20: No error handling in REST API calls (test harness)

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:313-319`

**Description:** The `api()` helper function has no try/catch, no `res.ok` check:

```javascript
async function api(method, path, params = {}, body = null) {
    const url = new URL(`${API_BASE}${path}`);
    Object.entries(params).forEach(([k, v]) => url.searchParams.set(k, v));
    const opts = { method, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } };
    if (body) opts.body = JSON.stringify(body);
    const res = await fetch(url, opts);
    return res.json();  // Throws if !res.ok or network error
}
```

Callers like `loadTab()` (line 330), `searchMemories()` (line 381), `searchContacts()` (line 388), `addTodo()` (line 395) also lack error handling.

**Consequence:** If the server returns 4xx/5xx or is unreachable, `res.json()` throws an unhandled promise rejection. The UI shows nothing — no error message, no feedback. The user has no way to know what went wrong.

**Fix:**

```javascript
async function api(method, path, params = {}, body = null) {
    try {
        const url = new URL(`${API_BASE}${path}`);
        Object.entries(params).forEach(([k, v]) => url.searchParams.set(k, v));
        const opts = { method, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } };
        if (body) opts.body = JSON.stringify(body);
        const res = await fetch(url, opts);
        if (!res.ok) {
            const error = await res.text();
            throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status}: ${error}`);
        }
        return await res.json();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('API error:', err);
        throw err;  // Let callers handle or show toast
    }
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-21: Race condition in streaming token assembly (test harness)

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:207-219`

**Description:** The streaming token handler checks if the last DOM element is an incomplete AI message:

```javascript
case 'ai_token':
    const lastMsg = document.getElementById('messages').lastElementChild;
    if (lastMsg && lastMsg.classList.contains('ai') && !lastMsg.dataset.complete) {
        lastMsg.textContent += data.content;
    } else {
        addMsg('ai', data.content);
    }
    break;
```

If an intermediate event (like `tool_start`, `reasoning`, or `middleware`) arrives between two `ai_token` chunks, `lastElementChild` is no longer the AI message, causing a **new AI message element** to be created in the middle of a streaming response.

**Consequence:** The streaming AI response is split into multiple separate message bubbles in the UI. The user sees fragmented text that's hard to read and doesn't represent the actual conversational flow.

**Fix:** Maintain a reference to the current streaming message element:

```javascript
let streamingMessageEl = null;

case 'ai_token':
    if (!streamingMessageEl) {
        streamingMessageEl = addMsg('ai', data.content);
    } else {
        streamingMessageEl.textContent += data.content;
    }
    break;

case 'done':
case 'error':
    if (streamingMessageEl) {
        streamingMessageEl.dataset.complete = 'true';
        streamingMessageEl = null;
    }
    break;
```

**Severity:** Medium

## LOW 🔵

### BUG-22: Tool result messages skipped in history rebuild

**File:** `src/sdk/runner.py:147-149`

**Description:** When loading conversation history, `role == "tool"` messages are explicitly skipped:

```python
for msg in recent_messages:
    if msg["role"] == "tool":
        continue  # Skip tool results
```

**Consequence:** The LLM has no context about what tools previously executed and their results. If the user asks "what did you do last time?" or "what were the results of that search?", the model can't answer accurately because it doesn't have that context.

**Fix:** Either include tool messages in the history, or provide a summary of recent tool executions as a system message.

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-23: `repair_tool_call` parameter `tool_def` unused

**File:** `src/sdk/validation.py:82`

**Description:** The function accepts `tool_def: ToolDefinition | None` but never references it:

```python
def repair_tool_call(
    tool_call: ToolCall,
    tool_def: ToolDefinition | None = None,  # UNUSED
) -> ToolCall:
```

**Consequence:** Dead parameter. Schema-aware repair (e.g., filling in default values for missing parameters based on the tool's schema) would significantly improve the success rate for malformed tool call arguments, but this parameter suggests the capability was planned and never implemented.

**Fix:** Either implement schema-aware repair (use `tool_def.parameters` to validate/fix arguments) or remove the parameter.

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-24: All historic instructions replayed on first poll

**File:** `src/sdk/middleware_instruction.py:30,49`

**Description:** `_last_checked` initializes to `""` (empty string). The filtering expression at line 49:

```python
new = [i for i in instructions if i["created_at"] > self._last_checked] if self._last_checked else instructions
```

Uses truthiness — empty string is falsy. On the very first poll, `new = instructions` — returning ALL historic instructions from the work queue.

**Consequence:** Every past supervisor instruction is re-injected as system messages. This can flood the LLM's context window with stale, irrelevant, or contradictory directives from previous task invocations.

**Fix:** Initialize to a sentinel value that's truthy but old:

```python
self._last_checked = "1970-01-01T00:00:00"  # Ancient timestamp
```

Or use `None` with explicit `is None` check:

```python
self._last_checked: str | None = None
# ...
new = [i for i in instructions if self._last_checked is None or i["created_at"] > self._last_checked]
```

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-25: `max_iterations` (25) vs `max_llm_calls` (50) default mismatch

**File:** `src/sdk/loop.py:50-63,157`

**Description:** Two conflicting defaults:

```python
DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS = 25
DEFAULT_MAX_LLM_CALLS = 50
```

`AgentLoop.__init__` defaults `max_iterations=25`, but `RunConfig.__init__` defaults `max_llm_calls=50`. When creating a `RunConfig(max_iterations=25)`, the RunConfig's `max_llm_calls` stays at 50. In the loop, both limits are checked:

```python
if self.iteration >= self.max_iterations: break
if self.run_config and self.run_config.max_llm_calls and self._llm_calls >= self.run_config.max_llm_calls: break
```

**Consequence:** If only `max_iterations=25` is set (which most callers do), the effective limit is 50 LLM calls (the RunConfig default). This means up to 50 LLM invocations can occur instead of the expected 25.

**Fix:** Align the defaults or derive `RunConfig` from the `AgentLoop` defaults:

```python
DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS = 50
DEFAULT_MAX_LLM_CALLS = 50
```

Or have `AgentLoop` sync `RunConfig.max_llm_calls` from its own `max_iterations` when constructing the config.

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-26: Dead duplicate check for `list` origin in `_python_type_to_json_schema`

**File:** `src/sdk/tools.py:140-153`

**Description:** The function checks `origin is list` twice:

```python
if origin is list:  # Line 140-146
    return {"type": "array", "items": ...}

if tp.__origin__ is list:  # Line 152-153 — DEAD CODE
    return {"type": "array", "items": ...}
```

After Python 3.9+, `list[str]` has `__origin__ is list` but the first check already covers this case. The second `if` block is unreachable.

**Consequence:** Harmless dead code, but it indicates an incomplete refactoring. Could mask logic issues during maintenance if someone modifies the first branch.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate check.

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-27: Unbounded DOM growth — no virtual scrolling in test harness

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:26`

**Description:** The `#messages` div accumulates all messages indefinitely:

```html
<div id="messages" class="messages"></div>
```

Messages are appended but never removed or trimmed. Over very long sessions (thousands of messages), the DOM tree grows unbounded.

**Consequence:** After ~1,000+ messages in a single session:
- Scroll performance degrades
- Memory usage climbs
- Browser may become unresponsive
- Event listeners accumulate (if any are attached per-message)

**Fix:** Implement DOM trimming — keep only the last N messages (e.g., 500) and remove older ones, or implement virtual scrolling.

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-28: No interrupt approval timeout — UI stuck indefinitely

**File:** `tests/api/test_harness.html:109`

**Description:** `pendingInterrupt` is set when an `interrupt` event arrives and cleared on approve/reject. There is no timeout mechanism:

```javascript
let pendingInterrupt = null;

case 'interrupt':
    pendingInterrupt = data;
    showInterruptUI(data);
    break;
```

**Consequence:** If the user never clicks approve or reject, the interrupt stays pending forever. The UI is in an ambiguous state with buttons visible but no action happening. The backend may timeout, but the UI never updates.

**Fix:** Add a configurable timeout that auto-rejects or shows a warning:

```javascript
let interruptTimeout;

case 'interrupt':
    pendingInterrupt = data;
    showInterruptUI(data);
    interruptTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        autoRejectInterrupt(data);
    }, 120000);  // 2-minute timeout
    break;

function approveInterrupt() {
    clearTimeout(interruptTimeout);
    // ... existing approve logic
}
```

### BUG-03 — Detailed Analysis

The fix at `src/sdk/middleware_summarization.py:226`:

```python
224:        summary_text = summary_msg.content or ""
225:
226:        self._last_summary_msg_count = len(new_messages)   # ← REFERENCES new_messages
227:
228:        summary_msg = Message.system(...)
229:
230:        new_messages = list(system_messages) + [summary_msg] + list(messages[split_idx:])  # ← ASSIGNED HERE
```

`new_messages` is **loaded** at line 226 but **stored** for the first time at line 230. At runtime this raises:

```
NameError: name 'new_messages' is not defined
```

This crash fires exactly when summarization is most needed — during long conversations approaching the token limit. The summarization guard permanently disables after the crash, causing unbounded context growth.

**Correct fix:** Move the assignment after line 230, or pre-compute the count:

```python
# Option A: Move after line 230
new_messages = list(system_messages) + [summary_msg] + list(messages[split_idx:])
self._last_summary_msg_count = len(new_messages)

# Option B: Pre-compute
self._last_summary_msg_count = len(system_messages) + 1 + len(messages[split_idx:])
```

### FLUTTER CRITICAL 🔴

### BUG-F01: Silent pending message loss on fail-to-send during reconnect

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:209-227`

**Description:** When the WebSocket reconnects and a `pong` event triggers pending message delivery (line 218-224), if `_send()` fails (it silently catches all errors on line 203-204 with a debug print), the pending message is **unconditionally cleared** on line 225:

```dart
void _onPong() {
  if (_pendingMessage != null) {
    _send(_pendingMessage!);  // May fail silently
    _pendingMessage = null;   // Cleared regardless of success
  }
}
```

**Consequence:** A user's message is permanently lost with zero feedback. The user sent a message, the UI shows it was queued during reconnect, but if the send fails during the pong window, it vanishes silently. The user doesn't know their message was never delivered.

**Fix:** Only clear `_pendingMessage` on successful send. Track send result and surface failure to the UI:

```dart
void _onPong() {
  if (_pendingMessage != null) {
    try {
      _send(_pendingMessage!);
      _pendingMessage = null;
    } catch (e) {
      // Keep _pendingMessage for next reconnect cycle or surface error
      _onError?.call('Failed to deliver queued message: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

**Severity:** Critical

---

### BUG-F02: Fire-and-forget `loadHistory()` in `_onStatusChange` — no error handling, no await

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:417-420`

**Description:** `loadHistory()` is called without `await` inside `_onStatusChange`:

```dart
void _onStatusChange(WsConnectionStatus status) {
  if (status == WsConnectionStatus.connected) {
    loadHistory();  // ← Fire-and-forget, no await
    ...
  }
}
```

`loadHistory()` is an `async` method that performs HTTP requests and mutates state via `state = ...`. If it throws (JSON decode failure, network error, timeout), the exception is only caught by the app's zone handler with no user-visible feedback. Furthermore, during the async gap while `loadHistory()` is in-flight, other events like `_onMessage` can mutate state concurrently, potentially interleaving or overwriting `loadHistory()`'s state updates.

**Consequence:** 
- History load failures are invisible — the user sees an empty chat with no indication
- Concurrent state mutations from incoming WebSocket messages during the load can produce corrupted history ordering
- If load finishes after new messages arrive via WebSocket, those messages get overwritten by the load result

**Fix:** `await` the call and handle errors:

```dart
void _onStatusChange(WsConnectionStatus status) async {
  if (status == WsConnectionStatus.connected) {
    try {
      await loadHistory();
    } catch (e) {
      // Set error state so UI can show a message
      state = state.copyWith(errorMessage: 'Failed to load history: $e');
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

Or use a proper state machine to prevent overlap between loading and live message processing.

**Severity:** Critical

### BUG-F03: Single `_pendingMessage` silently overwrites second message during reconnect

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:144-156`

**Description:** The client uses a single `_pendingMessage` field — at most one message is queued during reconnection:

```dart
String? _pendingMessage;

void send(String message) {
  if (_channel == null || _status != WsConnectionStatus.connected) {
    _pendingMessage = message;  // Overwrites any previous pending
    _connect();
    return;
  }
  _send(message);
}
```

**Consequence:** If the user sends two messages before reconnection completes, the first is silently overwritten and permanently lost. The user sees both messages in their UI (the provider may optimistically add them), but only the second actually reaches the server.

**Fix:** Use a queue instead of a single field:

```dart
final List<String> _pendingMessages = [];

void send(String message) {
  if (_channel == null || _status != WsConnectionStatus.connected) {
    _pendingMessages.add(message);
    _connect();
    return;
  }
  _send(message);
}

void _onPong() {
  while (_pendingMessages.isNotEmpty) {
    final msg = _pendingMessages.removeAt(0);
    try {
      _send(msg);
    } catch (e) {
      _pendingMessages.insert(0, msg);  // Put back on failure
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

**Severity:** Critical

---

### FLUTTER HIGH 🟠

### BUG-F04: `_channel!.ready.then(...)` — fire-and-forget with no error handling

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:109-114`

**Description:** The `_channel!.ready.then((_) { ... })` callback uses bare `then()` without `.catchError()`:

```dart
_channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(uri);
_channel!.ready.then((_) {
  _status = WsConnectionStatus.connected;
  _send('{"type": "ping"}');
  _onStatusChange?.call(WsConnectionStatus.connected);
});
```

**Consequence:** If `_send('{"type": "ping"}')` fails inside the `then()` callback (e.g., the sink was closed between ready and send, encoding error), the error is an unhandled `Future` error. It gets caught by the global zone handler but the `_onPong` pending-message-delivery mechanism never triggers because the server never receives the ping and thus never sends pong. This can leave the client in a state where it thinks it's connected but the server-side session was never established.

**Fix:** Wrap in try/catch and use `catchError`:

```dart
_channel!.ready.then((_) {
  _status = WsConnectionStatus.connected;
  try {
    _send('{"type": "ping"}');
    _onStatusChange?.call(WsConnectionStatus.connected);
  } catch (e) {
    _handleError(e);
  }
}).catchError((e) {
  _handleError(e);
});
```

**Severity:** High

### BUG-F05: Desktop chat bubble `maxWidth` uses screen width instead of panel width

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/widgets/message_bubble.dart:27`, `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/widgets/streaming_bubble.dart:17`

**Description:** Both `MessageBubble` and `StreamingBubble` compute their max width from the full screen:

```dart
final maxWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.75;
```

In the desktop layout (`desktop_layout.dart`), the chat panel occupies only 60% of the remaining space after the sidebar:

```dart
final contentWidth = (availableWidth - sidebarWidth) * 0.6;
```

So `maxWidth` = 75% of screen width, but the actual chat panel is ~40% of screen width. Messages routinely overflow the panel bounds, causing RenderFlex overflow warnings.

**Consequence:** On desktop/wider layouts, message bubbles extend beyond the chat panel's right edge, clipped or overflowing. Text is unreadable, layout errors spam the debug console.

**Fix:** Use `LayoutBuilder` to compute width from the available space, not screen width:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      final maxWidth = constraints.maxWidth * 0.75;
      return Container(
        constraints: BoxConstraints(maxWidth: maxWidth),
        child: ...,
      );
    },
  );
}
```

Or pass the panel width down from the parent layout.

### BUG-F06: `ApprovalSheet` only renders first pending approval — all others invisible

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/widgets/approval_sheet.dart:15`

**Description:** The approval sheet renders only the first entry from `pendingApprovals`:

```dart
final tc = pendingApprovals.values.first;
```

`pendingApprovals` is a `Map<String, ToolCall>` that can contain multiple concurrent pending tool calls. The sheet shows only the first one.

**Consequence:** If the agent requests approval for multiple tool calls simultaneously (e.g., `files_delete` + `email_send` in one response), the user can see and act on only the first one. All other pending approvals are invisible. The tools stay pending until timeout or the user closes the sheet and re-opens it — and even then, only the next one becomes visible.

**Fix:** Render all pending approvals in a `ListView`:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final approvals = pendingApprovals.values.toList();
  if (approvals.isEmpty) {
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    return const SizedBox.shrink();
  }
  return ListView.builder(
    shrinkWrap: true,
    itemCount: approvals.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      final tc = approvals[index];
      return _buildApprovalCard(tc);
    },
  );
}
```

### BUG-F07: `pendingApprovals.isEmpty` returns `SizedBox.shrink()` in open bottom sheet

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/widgets/approval_sheet.dart:13-14`

**Description:** When `pendingApprovals` is empty, the widget returns `SizedBox.shrink()`:

```dart
if (pendingApprovals.isEmpty) {
  return const SizedBox.shrink();
}
```

But the bottom sheet is already open. A `SizedBox.shrink()` in a bottom sheet produces a blank, zero-height overlay. The user must manually swipe it away.

**Consequence:** An empty bottom sheet overlay covers part of the screen with no content, blocking interaction. The user sees a dimmed background with nothing to interact with, or worse — the sheet renders as an invisible overlay.

**Fix:** Pop the sheet if empty:

```dart
if (pendingApprovals.isEmpty) {
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    if (Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
    }
  });
  return const SizedBox.shrink();
}
```

Or check before opening the sheet in `chat_screen.dart`.

### BUG-F08: Build context used after async gap in approval sheet flow

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart:56-73`

**Description:** The `ref.listen` callback uses the build's `context` to call `showModalBottomSheet`:

```dart
ref.listen(agentProvider.select((s) => s.status), (prev, next) {
  if (prev?.status != ChatStatus.awaitingApproval && next.status == ChatStatus.awaitingApproval) {
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,  // ← context from build method
      builder: (ctx) => const ApprovalSheet(),
    );
  }
});
```

If the widget is disposed or in the process of being disposed when this callback fires (possible during rapid state transitions or app lifecycle changes), `context` may be invalid or the `Navigator` may not be available.

**Consequence:** Runtime crash: "Navigator operation requested with a context that does not include a Navigator" or "This widget has been unmounted, so the State no longer has a context."

**Fix:** Check `mounted` before using context, or use a `GlobalKey<NavigatorState>`:

```dart
ref.listen(agentProvider.select((s) => s.status), (prev, next) {
  if (!mounted) return;
  if (prev?.status != ChatStatus.awaitingApproval && next.status == ChatStatus.awaitingApproval) {
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (ctx) => const ApprovalSheet(),
    );
  }
});
```

**Severity:** High

### BUG-F09: `cancelExecution()` forces idle status ignoring actual connection state

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:177-179`

**Description:** Cancelling execution unconditionally sets status to idle:

```dart
void cancelExecution() {
  _wsClient?.send(jsonEncode({'type': 'cancel_execution'}));
  state = state.copyWith(status: ChatStatus.idle);
}
```

**Consequence:** If the WebSocket was already disconnected when the user hits cancel, the UI shows "idle" when the real state should be "disconnected." The user sees a ready state and tries to send a message, but the connection is actually down. The status and reality diverge.

**Fix:** Check the actual connection status:

```dart
void cancelExecution() {
  _wsClient?.send(jsonEncode({'type': 'cancel_execution'}));
  state = state.copyWith(
    status: _wsClient?.status == WsConnectionStatus.connected
        ? ChatStatus.idle
        : ChatStatus.disconnected,
  );
}
```

### FLUTTER MEDIUM 🟡

### BUG-F10: Multiple rapid `interrupt` events could queue overlapping bottom sheets

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart:62-72`

**Description:** The guard `prev?.status != ChatStatus.awaitingApproval` only checks the Riverpod state. If a second interrupt arrives while the first sheet is animating (after showing but before the state updates), the guard passes and another `showModalBottomSheet` is called.

**Consequence:** Two bottom sheets stack on top of each other. Dismissing the top one reveals the stale one beneath. The user might approve a tool on the stale sheet, which has already been handled.

**Fix:** Add a flag or use a `NavigatorState` to prevent double-showing:

```dart
bool _sheetShowing = false;

if (!_sheetShowing && next.status == ChatStatus.awaitingApproval) {
  _sheetShowing = true;
  final result = await showModalBottomSheet(...);
  _sheetShowing = false;
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F11: `updateHost()` / `updateUserId()` don't trigger reconnect

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:189-197`

**Description:** Changing the host or user ID updates string fields in the clients without reconnecting:

```dart
void updateHost(String host) {
  _wsClient?.host = host;
  _apiClient?.baseUrl = host;
}
void updateUserId(String userId) {
  _wsClient?.userId = userId;
  _apiClient?.userId = userId;
}
```

**Consequence:** The existing WebSocket connection continues using the old values. The user changed the host to point to a different server, but the connection is still talking to the old server. Messages go to the wrong backend. The user must manually disconnect and reconnect — which is non-obvious.

**Fix:** Trigger reconnection after updating:

```dart
void updateHost(String host) {
  _wsClient?.host = host;
  _apiClient?.baseUrl = host;
  disconnect();
  connect();
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F12: All errors silently swallowed in `loadHistory()` — empty `catch (e) {}`

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:123-125`

**Description:** The entire `loadHistory()` body is wrapped in an empty catch:

```dart
Future<void> loadHistory() async {
  try {
    final response = await _apiClient!.get('/conversation/history');
    ...
  } catch (e) {
    // Empty — swallows everything
  }
}
```

**Consequence:** Network failures, JSON parse errors, type mismatches, HTTP errors — all invisible. The chat appears empty with no feedback. Users are left confused, not knowing if there's no history or if loading failed. Debugging is impossible without adding logging.

**Fix:** Log the error and set error state:

```dart
catch (e, stack) {
  debugPrint('Failed to load history: $e\n$stack');
  state = state.copyWith(
    errorMessage: 'Failed to load conversation history',
  );
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F13: Missing `role` field defaults to `'user'`, misclassifying server messages

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:80`

**Description:** When parsing history messages, role defaults to `'user'`:

```dart
final role = msg['role']?.toString() ?? 'user';
```

**Consequence:** If the server omits the `role` field from any message or returns it as `null`, that message is classified as a user message. It renders incorrectly (right-aligned with user bubble styling). If it's actually a system message or an assistant message missing its role, the chat history appears corrupted.

**Fix:** Default to a more appropriate value or skip messages with missing roles:

```dart
final role = msg['role']?.toString();
if (role == null) {
  debugPrint('History message missing role, skipping: $msg');
  continue;
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F14: Malformed timestamps all collapse to `DateTime.now()`, breaking sort order

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:88-89`

**Description:** Bad timestamps all get the same `now` value:

```dart
final timestamp = DateTime.tryParse(ts) ?? DateTime.now();
```

**Consequence:** When sorted by timestamp, messages with malformed timestamps all collapse to the same instant. This produces incorrect chronological ordering — messages jump around in the chat list, appearing out of sequence.

**Fix:** Use the message's position in the list as a fallback ordering, or assign incrementing timestamps:

```dart
final timestamp = DateTime.tryParse(ts) ?? DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(
  DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch - (messages.length - index),
);
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F15: `listMemories()` double-encodes `user_id` in URL query string

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/api_client.dart:29-36` + `api_client.dart:47-55`

**Description:** `listMemories` passes `user_id` as an extra parameter into `_buildUrl`, which already includes `user_id` from `_queryParams`:

```dart
// In _buildUrl: queryParams already has {'user_id': _userId}
// In listMemories:
Future<dynamic> listMemories({int limit = 50}) {
  return _get('/memories', extra: {'limit': limit, 'user_id': _userId});
}
```

**Consequence:** The URL gets `?user_id=alice&limit=50&user_id=alice` — duplicated parameter. Most HTTP frameworks use the first or last occurrence, but behavior is undefined. Could silently switch between values if the parameter ordering changes.

**Fix:** Remove the redundant `user_id` from the `extra` map:

```dart
Future<dynamic> listMemories({int limit = 50}) {
  return _get('/memories', extra: {'limit': limit});
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F16: `MobileLayout` `indexWhere` fallback to index 0 for unknown/deep routes

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/core/layout/mobile_layout.dart:19-30`

**Description:** Unknown routes incorrectly highlight the Home tab:

```dart
int selectedIndex = tabPaths.indexWhere((path) => currentRoute.startsWith(path));
if (selectedIndex == -1) selectedIndex = 0;  // Home tab
```

**Consequence:** Navigating to a deep route (e.g., settings, subagent detail) highlights the Home tab as active. The navigation UI shows the wrong active state, confusing users about which section they're in.

**Fix:** Only change the index for matching routes; for non-matching routes, don't update the tab:

```dart
int selectedIndex = tabPaths.indexWhere((path) => currentRoute.startsWith(path));
// Don't force to 0 for unknown routes — keep previous state
```

**Severity:** Medium

### BUG-F17: `_ChatPanelState.initState()` calls `connect()` synchronously, delaying first frame

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/core/layout/desktop_layout.dart:190-191`

**Description:** WebSocket connection is initiated during `initState`:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _connect();
}
```

**Consequence:** `initState` runs synchronously before the first build. `WebSocketChannel.connect()` does blocking DNS resolution and TCP handshake. On slow networks, this delays the first frame paint, causing jank or a visible freeze.

**Fix:** Schedule the connection after the first frame:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) => _connect());
}
```

**Severity:** Medium

### FLUTTER LOW 🔵

### BUG-F18: `reasoning_delta` events completely discarded — only TODO left

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:236-239`

**Description:** Reasoning events are silently consumed with a TODO comment:

```dart
case 'reasoning_delta':
  // TODO: show reasoning/thinking content
  break;
```

**Consequence:** When using reasoning models (Anthropic extended thinking, Gemini thinkingConfig), the user sees absolutely nothing for the thinking phase. The UI sits silent while the model processes, giving the impression of freezing or slowness.

**Fix:** Render reasoning content in a collapsible section:

```dart
case 'reasoning_delta':
  final content = data['content'] as String?;
  if (content != null) {
    state = state.copyWith(
      currentReasoning: (state.currentReasoning ?? '') + content,
    );
  }
  break;
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F19: `tool_input_delta` streaming tool arguments silently ignored

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:263-266`

**Description:** Streaming tool argument deltas are discarded:

```dart
case 'tool_input_delta':
  // TODO: progressive tool argument display
  break;
```

**Consequence:** For long-running tool argument generation (e.g., writing a large file), the user sees no progress until the entire argument is complete. Tool execution appears to start suddenly with no preamble.

**Fix:** Accumulate and display partial tool arguments:

```dart
case 'tool_input_delta':
  final callId = data['call_id'] as String?;
  final delta = data['content'] as String?;
  if (callId != null && delta != null) {
    state = state.copyWith(
      pendingToolArgs: {
        ...state.pendingToolArgs,
        callId: (state.pendingToolArgs[callId] ?? '') + delta,
      },
    );
  }
  break;
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F20: `usage`/token events silently discarded — no cost tracking in UI

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart:300-305`

**Description:** Usage events are consumed without tracking:

```dart
case 'usage':
  // Token/cost tracking not implemented in UI
  break;
```

**Consequence:** No token counts or cost estimates are visible to the user. For pay-per-token models, users have no visibility into spending. Token limits can be exceeded without warning.

**Fix:** Track and display usage:

```dart
case 'usage':
  final inputTokens = data['input_tokens'] as int?;
  final outputTokens = data['output_tokens'] as int?;
  if (inputTokens != null || outputTokens != null) {
    state = state.copyWith(
      totalInputTokens: (state.totalInputTokens ?? 0) + (inputTokens ?? 0),
      totalOutputTokens: (state.totalOutputTokens ?? 0) + (outputTokens ?? 0),
    );
  }
  break;
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F21: `_send()` catches all exceptions silently — caller gets no error notification

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:200-207`

**Description:** Any send failure is only logged to debug console:

```dart
void _send(String message) {
  try {
    _channel!.sink.add(message);
  } catch (e) {
    debugPrint('WsClient: send error: $e');
    // No callback, no Future, no error handler for caller
  }
}
```

**Consequence:** Callers (`send()`, `_onPong()`, ping handlers) have absolutely no way of knowing their message was not delivered. Messages silently fail with no UI feedback. The user thinks their message was sent, but the server never received it.

**Fix:** Expose an error callback or return a `Future`:

```dart
void Function(String error)? onSendError;

void _send(String message) {
  try {
    _channel!.sink.add(message);
  } catch (e) {
    debugPrint('WsClient: send error: $e');
    onSendError?.call('Failed to send message: $e');
  }
}
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F22: Binary WebSocket data silently dropped with no visibility

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:211`

**Description:** Non-string WebSocket frames are silently ignored:

```dart
_channel!.stream.listen((data) {
  if (data is! String) return;  // Silently drops binary frames
  _handleMessage(data);
});
```

**Consequence:** If the server ever sends binary frames (ping heartbeat, encoding change, protocol upgrade), the data is lost with zero logging. The behavior is invisible. Debugging why a server is "not responding" becomes impossible because the frames are silently discarded.

**Fix:** At minimum, log unexpected frame types:

```dart
_channel!.stream.listen((data) {
  if (data is! String) {
    debugPrint('WsClient: received unexpected binary frame (${data.runtimeType}), ignoring');
    return;
  }
  _handleMessage(data);
});
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F23: Desktop content area `SizedBox` exact width — no horizontal scroll fallback

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/core/layout/desktop_layout.dart:62`

**Description:** Child widgets get an exact fixed-width `SizedBox`:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: contentWidth,
  child: child,
)
```

**Consequence:** If any child content exceeds the fixed width (bug F05 makes this more likely), Flutter throws a `RenderFlex` overflow error with yellow/black stripes in debug mode. No horizontal scrolling or overflow handling.

**Fix:** Allow horizontal overflow handling via `SingleChildScrollView`:

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  child: SizedBox(
    width: contentWidth,
    child: child,
  ),
)
```

Or use `ClipRect` to at least clip visually instead of showing overflow warnings.

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F24: `SmartGreeting` calls `DateTime.now()` four separate times — midnight race

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/home/widgets/smart_greeting.dart:9-18`

**Description:** `DateTime.now()` is called on lines 9, 16, 17, and 18 independently:

```dart
final now = DateTime.now();
final hour = now.hour;
// ...
final dayName = _getDayName(DateTime.now().weekday);  // Different DateTime.now()!
final monthName = _getMonthName(DateTime.now().month);  // Different again!
final day = DateTime.now().day;  // Different again!
```

**Consequence:** Between 23:59:59 on December 31 and 00:00:01 on January 1, these four separate calls could return **different dates**. The greeting could say "Good evening" (from the first call showing evening), but the day name and date could show "Thursday, January 1" (from later calls that crossed midnight). The display is inconsistent and confusing.

**Fix:** Capture one timestamp and derive all values:

```dart
final now = DateTime.now();
final hour = now.hour;
final dayName = _getDayName(now.weekday);
final monthName = _getMonthName(now.month);
final day = now.day;
```

### BUG-F25: `QuickActions` chip callbacks are nullable, do nothing on desktop

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/features/home/widgets/quick_actions.dart:5-7` + `home_screen.dart:186`

**Description:** The desktop home screen instantiates `QuickActions()` with all three callbacks as `null`:

```dart
// Desktop home — all callbacks are null (default)
QuickActions(),
```

But the chips are `ActionChip` widgets that look tappable (material design ripple, active color). Tapping them does nothing because optional callbacks are null.

**Consequence:** Inconsistent UX — on mobile, tapping quick actions navigates to the relevant section. On desktop, the same chips appear but are dead. Users try to tap them and nothing happens.

**Fix:** Either hide `QuickActions` on desktop when no callbacks exist, or provide desktop-appropriate callbacks:

```dart
QuickActions(
  onTapChat: () => /* navigate to or focus chat panel */,
  ...
)
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F26: `tool_end` unconditionally removes from `_pendingApprovals` — masks duplicates

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/ws_client.dart:261-264`

**Description:** `_pendingApprovals.remove(callId)` runs on every `tool_end`, regardless of whether the tool was ever pending:

```dart
case 'tool_end':
  final callId = data['call_id'] as String?;
  if (callId != null) {
    _pendingApprovals.remove(callId);  // Unconditional remove
  }
  break;
```

**Consequence:** While `Map.remove()` on a non-existent key is harmless (returns null), this could mask real bugs — if `tool_end` is duplicated or misrouted from the server, the unconditional removal prevents detection. If two different tools somehow share a call ID, one would silently wipe the other's pending state.

**Fix:** Only remove if the key exists, and warn on unexpected removal:

```dart
if (callId != null) {
  if (_pendingApprovals.containsKey(callId)) {
    _pendingApprovals.remove(callId);
  } else {
    debugPrint('WsClient: tool_end for non-pending call $callId');
  }
}
```

**Severity:** Low

### BUG-F27: `dividerCount` hardcoded to 2 with no enforcement on layout alignment

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/core/layout/desktop_layout.dart:46,52-53`

**Description:** Divider count is a constant with no connection to actual divider widgets:

```dart
const dividerCount = 2;
final panelWidth = (availableWidth - sidebarWidth - dividerCount) / 3;
```

The `Container(width: 1, ...)` divider widgets are hardcoded in the Row. If someone adds or removes a divider, the math silently drifts because `dividerCount` stays at 2.

**Consequence:** Adding a third divider panel produces a layout that's 1px narrower than expected per panel. Over three panels, the error accumulates. It's subtle and hard to notice — everything looks "mostly right" but alignment is off by 1-2px.

**Fix:** Derive the count from the actual divider list, or use a single source of truth:

```dart
final dividers = [Divider(), Divider()];
const dividerCount = dividers.length;
// Use dividers list in the Row
```

**Severity:** Low

---

### BUG-F28: `TestInstrumentation` sequence counter has marginal thread safety risk

**File:** `flutter_app/lib/services/test_instrumentation.dart:24-25`

**Description:** The sequence counter is incremented without atomic operations:

```dart
int _sequence = 0;

void log(String event, {Map<String, dynamic>? data}) {
  _sequence++;
  final seq = _sequence;
  ...
}
```

**Consequence:** In Dart's single-isolate model, this is practically safe. However, `TestInstrumentation` is a singleton receiving events from multiple sources (widget lifecycle, network callback zone, platform channel). Between `_sequence++` and reading `_sequence` for the log entry, another log call from a different source could increment again. The captured `seq` value and the actual `eventSequence` in the output could disagree.

**Fix:** Capture atomically:

```dart
final seq = ++_sequence;
```

**Severity:** Low

## Flutter Fix Status (Verified May 1, 2026)

Each bug re-verified against actual source code. See detailed notes for partially-fixed bugs.

| Bug | Severity | Status | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| BUG-F01 | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Fixed | `ws_client.dart`: replaced single `_pendingMessage` (String?) with `_pendingMessages` (List) queue; failed sends leave message in queue for next reconnect |
| BUG-F02 | 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Partial | `agent_provider.dart`: `_loadHistorySafely()` wraps `loadHistory()` with error handling, but call is still fire-and-forget (no `await`). Concurrent state mutations from incoming WebSocket messages can interleave with `loadHistory()`. See [F02 detail](#bug-f02-detail) below. |
| BUG-F03 | 🔴 Critical | ✅ Fixed | `ws_client.dart`: `_pendingMessages` is now a `List`; each new message is appended instead of overwriting |
| BUG-F04 | 🟠 High | ✅ Fixed | `ws_client.dart`: `.catchError()` handler added; schedules reconnect on failure |
| BUG-F05 | 🟠 High | ✅ Fixed | `message_bubble.dart`, `streaming_bubble.dart`: `MediaQuery.size.width * 0.75` → `LayoutBuilder.maxWidth * 0.85` |
| BUG-F06 | 🟠 High | ✅ Fixed | `approval_sheet.dart`: renders all pending approvals via `pendingApprovals.values.toList()` + `ListView.builder` |
| BUG-F07 | 🟠 High | ✅ Fixed | `approval_sheet.dart`: empty sheet auto-pops via `addPostFrameCallback` + `Navigator.pop()` |
| BUG-F08 | 🟠 High | 🟡 Partial | `chat_screen.dart`: `_sheetShowing` flag added to prevent overlapping sheets. **BUT** no `mounted` check after the async `showModalBottomSheet` gap — if widget is disposed during the sheet, `_sheetShowing` stays `true` permanently and no more approval sheets can ever open. See [F08 detail](#bug-f08-detail) below. |
| BUG-F09 | 🟠 High | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: `cancelExecution()` sets `ChatStatus.disconnected` when `!state.connected` |
| BUG-F10 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `chat_screen.dart`: `_sheetShowing` flag prevents concurrent bottom sheet stacking |
| BUG-F11 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: `updateHost`/`updateUserId` both call `disconnect()` + `connect()` |
| BUG-F12 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: empty `catch (e) {}` → `debugPrint` with error + stack trace |
| BUG-F13 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: messages without `role` are skipped (`continue`) instead of defaulting to `'user'` |
| BUG-F14 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: bad timestamps use staggered fallback `now.subtract(Duration(minutes: idx))` |
| BUG-F15 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Fixed | `api_client.dart`: removed duplicate `user_id` from `listMemories` extra params |
| BUG-F16 | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Partial | `mobile_layout.dart`: unknown routes no longer force Home tab highlight (was index 0). Falls back to last-selected tab. Better, but stale tab selection on deep routes is still incorrect UX. |
| BUG-F17 | 🟡 Medium | ❌ Not fixed | `desktop_layout.dart`: `initState` at line 190 still calls `connect()` synchronously with no error handling. WebSocket connect is async so it won't literally block the frame, but no error path if connect fails. |
| BUG-F18 | 🔵 Low | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: `reasoning_delta`, `reasoning_start`, `reasoning_end` all have explicit handler cases (consumed with TODO for future storage) |
| BUG-F19 | 🔵 Low | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: `tool_input_delta` and `tool_input_end` now have explicit handler cases |
| BUG-F20 | 🔵 Low | ✅ Fixed | `agent_provider.dart`: `usage` events now have explicit handler case with TODO for session tracking |
| BUG-F21 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `ws_client.dart`: `_send()` still silently catches all exceptions with only a `debugPrint`. No callback, no `Future` return, no status update. Callers have no way to know send failed. |
| BUG-F22 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `ws_client.dart`: binary WebSocket data still silently dropped with `if (data is! String) return;` — no logging, no visibility. |
| BUG-F23 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `desktop_layout.dart`: content panel at line 62 still has no horizontal scroll protection — `SizedBox` constrains width but overflow not handled. |
| BUG-F24 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `smart_greeting.dart`: `DateTime.now()` still called 4 separate times (lines 9, 16, 17, 18), risking midnight boundary display inconsistency. |
| BUG-F25 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `home_screen.dart`: `_DesktopHome` passes `const QuickActions()` with no callbacks at line 186 — action chips render as tappable but do nothing. |
| BUG-F26 | 🔵 Low | ✅ Fixed | `ws_client.dart`: `Map.remove(callId)` is safe in Dart even for non-existent keys. No stale state issue. |
| BUG-F27 | 🔵 Low | ✅ Fixed | `desktop_layout.dart`: `dividerCount = 2` correctly matches the 2 actual `Container(width: 1)` divider widgets. |
| BUG-F28 | 🔵 Low | ❌ Not fixed | `test_instrumentation.dart`: `_sequence` is still a plain `int` incremented non-atomically at line 45. Low practical risk in single-isolate Dart, but fix is trivial (`final seq = ++_sequence`). |

### BUG-F02 Detail

The fix added `_loadHistorySafely()` which wraps the body in try/catch and sets error state on failure. But the call site in `_onStatusChange()` is still fire-and-forget:

```dart
void _onStatusChange(WsConnectionStatus status) {
  if (status == WsConnectionStatus.connected) {
    _loadHistorySafely();  // 🔴 Not awaited — still fire-and-forget
    ...
  }
}
```

During the async gap while `_loadHistorySafely()` fetches history over HTTP, `_onMessage` can fire from the WebSocket stream and mutate state concurrently. If history loads after live messages, the loaded history overwrites newly arrived messages. The error surface is improved (failures are logged), but the concurrency bug remains.

**To complete the fix:** Either `await` the call (requires making `_onStatusChange` async) or gate live message processing until history load completes.

### BUG-F08 Detail

The fix added a `_sheetShowing` boolean to prevent double-stacking bottom sheets. However, the flow has an async gap:

```dart
void _showApprovalSheet() {
  if (_sheetShowing) return;
  _sheetShowing = true;
  showModalBottomSheet(...).then((_) {
    _sheetShowing = false;  // 🔴 Never runs if widget disposed
  });
}
```

If the widget is disposed while the bottom sheet is open (user navigates away, app backgrounded, rapid state transition), the `.then()` callback never fires and `_sheetShowing` remains `true` permanently. All subsequent approval events are silently ignored — no more sheets can ever open.

**To complete the fix:** Reset `_sheetShowing` in `dispose()`:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _sheetShowing = false;
  super.dispose();
}
```
