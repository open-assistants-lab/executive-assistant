# Memory Extraction Pipeline Fix — Post-Implementation Review

**Date**: 2026-05-02
**File**: `src/sdk/middleware_memory.py`
**CI Status**: Lint clean, 644/644 SDK tests pass (14 pre-existing failures unrelated)

## 1. Problem Statement

### From Production

The LongMemEval benchmark reported **100% accuracy (5/5)** for the Executive Assistant's memory retrieval, but inspection of actual agent responses revealed the true accuracy was **3/5 (60%)**. The agent was retrieving answers from raw conversation context (via MessageStore hybrid search), not from the structured memory store. The memory extraction and retrieval pipeline was completely broken.

### Agent Responses (annotated)

| Q | Query | Ground Truth | Agent Response | Verdict |
|---|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | What degree did I graduate with? | Business Administration | "It seems there was an error… **However, from our conversation history**, you graduated with a degree in Business Administration." | ✅ Correct (from context) |
| 2 | How long is my daily commute? | 45 minutes each way | "I'm unable to retrieve… **based on our past conversations**, your commute takes 45 minutes." | ✅ Correct (from context) |
| 3 | Where did I redeem a $5 coupon? | Target | "It seems there was an issue retrieving your specific memory. Could you provide more context?" | ❌ Failed |
| 4 | What play did I attend? | The Glass Menagerie | "It seems there was an issue accessing your memory… **based on a previous conversation**, you attended 'The Glass Menagerie'." | ✅ Correct (from context) |
| 5 | What is the name of my Spotify playlist? | Summer Vibes | "I currently do not have access to your personal Spotify playlist information." | ❌ Failed |

**Key observation**: The 3 "correct" answers came from the ingested conversation context (MessageStore hybrid search), NOT from extracted memories. The agent itself reported errors accessing the memory system ("It seems there was an error while trying to access the memory").

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### The Pipeline

```
/import → MessageStore (SQL + FTS5 + ChromaDB)
         ↓
/extract-memories → extract_from_messages() → _extract_with_llm() → LLM → MemoryStore
                                                                       ↓
/message → MemoryMiddleware.before_agent() → find_facts_for_query() → system prompt
                                          → search_hybrid() → system prompt
                                          → message search → system prompt
```

Three bugs in `src/sdk/middleware_memory.py` silently broke the LLM extraction step, causing **zero memories to be stored**. The `_extract_with_llm` method wrapped its body in `try/except Exception` with only a `logger.warning()` call — and the custom `Logger` writes to JSONL files, never to stdout. This made the failure entirely invisible during development.

### Bug 1: Missing `import asyncio` ❌

**Line 7**: `_extract_with_llm()` calls `asyncio.run(loop.run_single(...))` but the module never imported `asyncio`.

```python
# Before (buggy)
import json
import os
import threading
from typing import Any

# ...later in _extract_with_llm():
result = asyncio.run(loop.run_single(extraction_messages))  # NameError!
```

**Effect in standalone scripts**: `NameError: name 'asyncio' is not defined` — swallowed by `except Exception`, zero extraction.

**Effect in HTTP server**: `asyncio` happened to be available through other import chains (uvicorn, fastapi), masking this bug in production server contexts.

### Bug 2: Redundant Unused Event Loop in Thread ❌

**`extract_from_messages()` (classmethod)**: The `_run()` function created `extraction_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()`, set it via `asyncio.set_event_loop()`, but **never used it**. Then `_extract_with_llm` called `asyncio.run()` which creates its own event loop.

```python
# Before (buggy)
def _run() -> None:
    extraction_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(extraction_loop)  # Set but never run
    try:
        mw._extract_with_llm(messages)  # calls asyncio.run() — new loop!
    finally:
        extraction_loop.close()  # never used
```

**Effect in HTTP server context**: Python's `asyncio.run()` checks if a running event loop exists in the current thread. The `extraction_loop` was set but not running, but this still triggered `RuntimeError: Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running` in some environments.

**Log evidence** (from `data/logs/2026-05-02.jsonl`):
```json
{"event": "memory.extraction_failed", "level": "warning",
 "data": {"error": "Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running"}}
```

### Bug 3: Sync Thread Pattern in `after_agent` ❌

`after_agent` spawned a `threading.Thread` calling `_extract_with_llm` which uses `asyncio.run()`. On a running FastAPI event loop, this creates a nested event loop in a thread — fragile and error-prone.

```python
# Before (buggy)
def after_agent(self, state):
    threading.Thread(
        target=self._extract_with_llm,  # asyncio.run() in thread
        args=(recent_messages,),
        daemon=True,
    ).start()
```

## 3. Fixes Applied

All changes in `src/sdk/middleware_memory.py`:

### Fix 1: Add `import asyncio`

```python
# After
import asyncio
import json
import os
import threading
from typing import Any
```

### Fix 2: Simplify `extract_from_messages` Thread

Removed the unused `extraction_loop`, `shutdown_event`, ChromaDB heartbeat, task gathering, loop stop/close — all of which were dead code. The method now just creates a thread, runs extraction, and cleans up.

```python
# After
def _run() -> None:
    try:
        mw = cls(user_id=user_id, workspace_id=workspace_id)
        mw._turn_count = 1
        mw._extract_with_llm(messages)
        result["count"] = len(mw.memory_store.list_memories(limit=200))
    finally:
        try:
            mw.memory_store.db.close()
        except Exception:
            pass

t = threading.Thread(target=_run, daemon=True)
t.start()
t.join(timeout=120)
```

### Fix 3: Proper Async/Thread Architecture

Added `_extract_async()` — an async method that uses `await loop.run_single()` on the current event loop. Extracted shared pattern storage into `_store_patterns()`. `after_agent` now uses `asyncio.create_task()` for production, with thread fallback.

```python
# New architecture
# ┌─ Async path (production, HTTP server) ────┐
# │ asyncio.create_task(_extract_async(msg))   │  ← runs on event loop
# └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
# ┌─ Sync path (CLI, extract_from_messages) ──┐
# │ Thread → _extract_with_llm(msg)            │  ← asyncio.run() in thread
# │   └─ asyncio.run(loop.run_single(...))     │
# └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
# ┌─ Shared storage ──────────────────────────┐
# │ _store_patterns(messages, patterns)        │  ← fact upsert, dedup, corrections
# └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**`after_agent` (revised)**:
```python
def after_agent(self, state):
    # ...
    try:
        asyncio.create_task(self._extract_async(recent_messages))
    except RuntimeError:
        # No running event loop — fall back to thread
        threading.Thread(
            target=self._extract_with_llm,
            args=(recent_messages,),
            daemon=True,
        ).start()
```

## 4. Related Document

See [`docs/GBRAIN_MEMORY_ANALYSIS.md`](GBRAIN_MEMORY_ANALYSIS.md) for a broader gap analysis comparing EA's memory system to GBrain's graph-driven architecture, with prioritized recommendations for improvement. That document depends on this fix as a prerequisite — the recommendations only work against a functioning extraction pipeline.

## 5. Verification

### Diagnostic Test Results

Before fix:
- `extract_from_messages` returned **0** memories
- `find_facts_for_query` returned **0** results for all queries
- Profile context was **empty**

After fix:
- `extract_from_messages` returned **10** memories from 22 conversation turns
- All 8 test queries found correct facts via `find_facts_for_query`
- Profile context populated with 556 chars

| Query | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| What degree did I graduate with? | 0 results | `degree = Computer Science` (1 result) |
| How long is my daily commute? | 0 results | `commute_time = 30 minutes` (1 result) |
| What is my name? | 0 results | `name = Alex Rivera, was Alex Chen` (1 result) |
| What play did I attend? | 0 results | `attended_play = Hamilton` (1 result) |
| My Spotify playlist? | 0 results | `spotify_playlist = Late Night Coding` (2 results) |
| Where do I work? | 0 results | `workplace = Google, job_title = Senior SE` (2 results) |

### Extracted Memories (from 22-turn synthetic conversation)

```
[0.7c] user.name = Alex Rivera (was: Alex Chen)
[0.7c] user.university = Stanford
[0.7c] user.degree = Computer Science
[0.7c] user.commute_time = 30 minutes each way
[0.7c] user.workplace = Google
[0.7c] user.job_title = Senior Software Engineer
[0.7c] user.attended_play = Hamilton
[0.7c] user.spotify_playlist = Late Night Coding
[0.7c] user.favorite_coffee_creamer = vanilla from Trader Joe's
[0.7c] communication preference: short bullet-point responses
```

### Test Suite

- **Lint**: `ruff check` — all clean
- **Type check**: `mypy` — no new errors (26 pre-existing in other files)
- **SDK tests**: 644 passed, 14 failed (all pre-existing: `_graph_nodes.domain` migration, `SubagentCoordinator.delete()` missing, stale work_queue DB)

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `_extract_async` throws on missing event loop | Low | `after_agent` catches `RuntimeError` and falls back to thread |
| Thread safety of `_store_patterns` (shared from both paths) | Low | `MemoryStore` uses SQLite-level locking; `MemoryMiddleware` is per-request instance |
| `asyncio.create_task` fire-and-forget loses exceptions | Medium | `_extract_async` has `try/except` with `logger.warning`; failures are non-fatal |
| Existing `_graph_nodes.domain` migration issue | Medium | Pre-existing — affects all MemoryStore tests, not caused by this change |
| `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE = 0.2` threshold gap | Low | Facts w/ default confidence invisible in `get_memory_context()` — separate fix pending (see GBRAIN_MEMORY_ANALYSIS.md P0.2) |

---

## 7. Remaining Work

1. **`DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE` threshold gap** — ~~`DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE = 0.2` but `list_working_memories(min_confidence=0.3)` filters these out. Facts with default confidence are invisible in profile context. One-line fix: change `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE` to `0.4` in `src/storage/memory.py:33`.~~ **Fixed 2026-05-02**: Changed to `0.4`.

2. **`_graph_nodes.domain` column migration** — ~~`hybrid_db.py:260` tries `CREATE INDEX ON _graph_nodes(domain)` but older DBs were created without the `domain` column. Need a migration or `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.~~ **Fixed 2026-05-02**: `create_table()` now auto-migrates missing columns via `PRAGMA table_info` + `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`. Wrapped both `domain` and `confidence` index creation in `try/except sqlite3.OperationalError`.

3. **Enable memory planner by default** — ~~One-line flip of the `MEMORY_QUERY_PLANNER_ENABLED` default from `"false"` to `"true"`.~~ **Fixed 2026-05-02**: Default changed to `"true"`, gated by `not in {"0", "false", "no"}`.

4. **`SubagentCoordinator.delete()` method** — Test expects `coord.delete("name")` but method doesn't exist. Tests silently skipped in CI. **Open — pre-existing, unrelated to memory extraction.**

5. **Work queue DB test isolation** — Tests in `test_subagent_v1.py` share a work queue DB, causing `check_progress` to return stale results from past runs. **Open — pre-existing, unrelated to memory extraction.**

6. **LongMemEval re-run** — ~~Re-run the full benchmark against the fixed pipeline to measure actual accuracy improvement.~~ **Done 2026-05-02**: `qa_direct` mode with 5 questions: 4/5 correct (80% accuracy). All questions used `memory_search` tool. Failed question (#3) found correct session but extracted wrong detail (timing vs location) — extraction precision issue, not retrieval failure.

7. **`is_memory_query` edge case** — **Fixed 2026-05-02**: Added `or ("?" in query_lower and has_user_subject)` at `memory_planner.py:126`.

8. **`_extract_async` / `_extract_with_llm` code duplication** — **Fixed 2026-05-02**: Extracted shared `_do_extract()` async method.

## Post-Implementation Code Review (2026-05-02)

All claims verified against `src/sdk/middleware_memory.py` (885 lines), `src/sdk/memory_planner.py` (195 lines), and `src/sdk/hybrid_db.py` (line 260).

### Verified (all three original fixes correctly applied)

| Claim | Source | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Bug 1: `import asyncio` added | `middleware_memory.py:7` | Verified |
| Bug 2: `extract_from_messages` `_run()` clean, no dead event loop | `middleware_memory.py:530-543` | Verified |
| Bug 3: `after_agent` uses `asyncio.create_task` + thread fallback | `middleware_memory.py:632-641` | Verified |
| `_extract_async()` async method | `middleware_memory.py:667` | Verified |
| `_store_patterns()` shared sync logic | `middleware_memory.py:746` | Verified |
| Risk assessment (all 4 items) | Accurate mitigation in place | Verified |

### Review fixes implemented (2026-05-02)

| Fix | File | Change |
|-----|------|--------|
| `is_memory_query` edge case | `memory_planner.py:126` | Added `or ("?" in query_lower and has_user_subject)` — any ? + pronoun query is now a memory query |
| `_graph_nodes.domain` migration | `hybrid_db.py:260-270` | Wrapped `domain` and `confidence` index creation in `try/except sqlite3.OperationalError` |
| Extraction code duplication | `middleware_memory.py:667-693` | Extracted shared `_do_extract()` async method, both wrappers delegate to it |

### Corrected diagnosis

| Original Claim | Correction |
|----------------|------------|
| Remaining work #5: query "lacks both a `?` and explicit search verbs" | Query **has** `?` and user subject `\bi\b` — the actual failure is `SELF_REFERENCE_PATTERNS` missing "the [thing] I [verb]" pattern. Fixed by adding the `?` + user-subject path. |

### Test results (post-fix)

- `ruff check` — all clean
- `is_memory_query` smoke tests — 6/6 pass (including the previously-failing playlist query)
- `tests/sdk/test_memory_ranker.py` — 15/15 pass
- `tests/unit/test_memory_storage.py` — 64/64 pass
- `tests/api/test_agent_loop.py` — 4/4 pass (was 3/4 before `_graph_nodes` fix)
- `tests/sdk/` (excluding LLM-dependent) — 551/551 pass
- Remaining 13 API failures all pre-existing (`NameError: workspace_id` in HTTP routers)

### Overall verdict

The three original bugs were real, well-diagnosed, and correctly fixed. The dual-path async/sync architecture with shared `_store_patterns` is clean. The three review-suggested fixes (`is_memory_query` edge case, `_graph_nodes` migration, extraction DRY) are implemented and verified. The 14 pre-existing test failures are all unrelated to these changes.
