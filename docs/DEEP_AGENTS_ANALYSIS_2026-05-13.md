## What EA Should Adopt

### Priority 1 — Genuine Gaps With High Impact

#### 1. Context Offloading

Deep Agents auto-offloads large tool inputs/outputs (threshold: 20,000 tokens) to filesystem, replacing them with reference pointers and a 10-line preview. This prevents a single large file read or tool result from consuming the entire context window.

EA's `SummarizationMiddleware` compresses conversation history but doesn't handle individual large tool results. If `files_read` returns a 50KB file, that content sits in the conversation until summarization kicks in — and by then it's already consumed the window.

**How to adopt:** Add `ContentOffloadMiddleware` that wraps tool calls. When tool output exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10,000 tokens), save it to `data/users/{user_id}/offload/{tool}_{call_id}.txt`, replace the tool message with `[Content saved to /offload/...] First 10 lines: ...`. The agent can re-read via `files_read` if needed.

**Lines:** ~150. **Effort:** 1 day.

#### 2. Structured Subagent Output

Deep Agents' `response_format` forces subagents to return parseable JSON via Pydantic models. EA's subagents return free-form text — the parent must parse or trust the content.

**How to adopt:** Add `response_format` field to `AgentDef`. When set, the `SubagentCoordinator` passes the schema to the subagent's `AgentLoop.run()` and validates the output before returning to the parent.

**Lines:** ~80 in coordinator.py. **Effort:** ½ day.

#### 3. Sandbox Execution

Deep Agents wraps the `execute` tool to run in isolated environments (Modal, Daytona, Runloop). EA's `shell_execute` runs directly on the host system.

**Verdict: Not applicable for solo desktop.** For a solo user, `shell_execute` on the host is the intended behavior — you own the machine, you trust the agent. Isolation adds complexity with zero benefit. For multi-tenant deployments, the Docker setup in `DEPLOYMENT.md` already provides container-level isolation per user. Skip this.

### Priority 2 — Nice to Have

#### 4. Pluggable Filesystem Backend Interface

Deep Agents' `CompositeBackend` routes virtual paths to different storage backends (`/skills/` → Store, `/memories/` → State, `/workspace/` → Sandbox). EA's HybridDB uses the physical filesystem directly — no routing, no swappable backends.

**How to adopt:** Extract a `StorageBackend` protocol from HybridDB. Implement `LocalDiskBackend` (current behavior) and `InMemoryBackend` (for testing). Wire through `_connect()`, `_init_chroma()`, and `_get_embedding()`. This is a refactor, not a feature — makes testing easier and enables future remote backends.

**Lines:** ~300 refactor. **Effort:** 2 days.

#### 5. Harness Profiles

Deep Agents' `HarnessProfile` bundles per-model defaults: system prompt, excluded tools, tool description overrides, middleware adjustments. When switching from Claude to Gemini, the profile auto-adjusts middleware. EA has `provider_options` but it only passes key-value metadata — no tool or middleware control.

**How to adopt:** Extend `RunConfig.provider_options` to include `excluded_tools`, `tool_description_overrides`, and `middleware_additions`. Look up by provider_id at `AgentLoop` creation. This enables model-specific tuning without code changes.

**Lines:** ~100. **Effort:** 1 day.

#### 6. Filesystem Permissions

Deep Agents' declarative rules (`allow read /workspace/*`, `deny write *.env`, first-match-wins) are applied to all filesystem tools. EA has `ToolAnnotations.destructive`/`readOnly` but no path-level access control.

**How to adopt:** Add a `FilesystemPolicy` model with `operations`, `paths` (glob), and `mode` (allow/deny). Pass to `CLIToolAdapter` and `files_*` tools. Evaluate in declaration order before every file operation. Useful for restricting subagent access.

**Lines:** ~100. **Effort:** 1 day.

### Priority 3 — Future

#### 7. Interpreters

QuickJS runtime lets agents compose tools programmatically — batch processing, data transformation, tool orchestration — without spawning shell processes. Useful but niche.

#### 8. Multimodal File Reading

Support images, video, audio, PDFs in `files_read`. Requires model support (Gemini, GPT-4V). EA's current models (Ollama) don't support this well. Wait until multimodal models are standard in EA.

## What NOT to Adopt

| Deep Agents feature | Why skip |
|---------------------|----------|
| **LangChain/LangGraph dependency** | EA replaced this with custom SDK. Deep Agents is built on top. Not relevant. |
| **System prompt assembly** | EA's middleware pattern (each middleware appends to system prompt) is equivalent to Deep Agents' layered prompt. |
| **Memory model** | EA's HybridDB + MemoryMiddleware + graph is more capable than Deep Agents' Store-backed `/memories/` files. |
| **Streaming model** | EA's block-structured streaming (text_start/delta/end, tool_input_start/delta/end) is equivalent. |
| **Checkpointer/durable execution** | EA's MessageStore + HybridDB provides durable state. Deep Agents uses LangGraph checkpointing. |
