# EA: Unified Tool / Skill / Subagent Scope Model

2026-06-03

## Context

Currently, the Tools panel has a `ScopeSwitcher` that toggles between "workspace" and
"personal" (user-level) views. Switching the scope swaps the entire tool list, which is
disorienting:

- You can't see what's enabled in "personal" while looking at a workspace view
- You have to toggle back and forth to compare or manage across scopes
- The "personal" vs "workspace" distinction is developer-centric, not user-centric
- Skills and Subagents don't have a scope switcher at all — inconsistent with Tools
- The split was introduced before workspaces could share tools, back when "personal"
  was the only way to apply settings globally

The goal is a single, unified model for enabling/disabling capabilities (tools, skills,
subagents) across workspaces — consistent UX across all three panels.

## Summary

Replace the `ScopeSwitcher` with a **three-state scope picker per item**:

| State | Badge (example) | Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **All** | `All ✓` (green) | Enabled in every workspace — existing and future |
| **Selected** | `3 WS ✓` (green) | Enabled for specific workspaces only. Tooltip on hover/long-press shows workspace names. |
| **None** | `Off` (grey) | Disabled in all workspaces |

Each tool/skill/subagent toggle becomes a popup menu (tap the state badge):

```
○ Enable for all workspaces
● Enable for selected workspaces…  ← reveals workspace checklist
○ Disable
```

When "Selected" is chosen, a modal dialog opens with a scrollable checklist of
all available workspaces and their checkboxes. User selects one or more, then
confirms with "Apply".

The `ScopeSwitcher` widget is removed from `ToolsPanel`, `SkillsSidebarPanel`, and
`SubagentsSidebarPanel`.

For Skills, this means skills stop being global-only — a user can now restrict a skill
to specific workspaces, same as tools.

For Subagents, same — agents can be scoped to the workspaces they're relevant for.

All three panels use identical state model and identical UX.

## Backend Changes

### GET endpoints

All three resource types return scope data alongside item metadata. Query by
workspace ID to filter — the backend resolves `scope=all` items automatically:

```
GET /tools?user_id=U&workspace_id=W

Response:
[
  {
    "name": "shell_execute",
    "description": "Execute shell commands",
    "category": "core",
    "enabled": true,              // computed for this workspace
    "scope": "all",               // all | selected | none
    "workspace_ids": [],          // when scope=selected, the list of workspace IDs
    "read_only": false,
    "destructive": true,
    …
  },
  {
    "name": "app_create",
    "description": "Create a new application",
    "category": "apps",
    "enabled": true,              // computed: scope=selected && W is in workspace_ids
    "scope": "selected",
    "workspace_ids": ["ws-1", "ws-2"],
    …
  },
  …
]
```

The `enabled` field is derived server-side — the frontend doesn't need to
compute intersection logic. Same pattern for `/skills` and `/subagents`.

### POST / PUT toggle endpoints

Current:

```
POST /tools/{name}?user_id=U&workspace_id=W    body: {enabled: true/false}
```

New:

```
POST /tools/{name}?user_id=U
body: {
  scope: "all" | "selected" | "none",
  workspace_ids: ["ws-1", "ws-2"]   // only when scope="selected"
}
```

Same for skills and subagents endpoints. The backend stores scope info per item,
keyed by (user_id, resource_type, resource_name).

If a resource has no row in `item_scopes`, the default scope applies:
- SDK-provided tools → `scope=all` (available everywhere)
- Registry-installed skills/subagents → `scope=all`
- User-created skills/subagents → `scope=selected` with current workspace

These defaults match Edge Cases 2, 3, and 6.

### Storage

A unified `item_scopes` table tracks scope per item:

```
item_scopes:
  user_id, resource_type (tool/skill/subagent), resource_name,
  scope (all/selected/none), workspace_ids (json list)
```

See Migration Path below for the conversion rules.

## Frontend Changes

### `ToolsPanel`

- Remove `_scope` state and `ScopeSwitcher` widget
- Load tools once per workspace (pass `workspace_id` query param)
- Each tool row shows a tappable scope badge that replaces the existing `Switch`
  widget — the badge communicates both enable state and scope in one tap target
- Badge tap opens a popup menu with human-readable options:
  "Enable for all workspaces" / "Enable for selected workspaces…" / "Disable"
- Choosing "Selected" opens a workspace multi-select dialog
- The header count shows "X / Y enabled" for the current workspace only

### `ScopePicker` (new shared widget)

A reusable widget used by Tools, Skills, and Subagents panels:

```dart
class ScopePicker extends StatelessWidget {
  final ScopeState scope;       // all, selected, none
  final List<String> workspaces; // ids of selected workspaces (when scope=selected)
  final List<Workspace> allWorkspaces; // all available workspaces
  final ValueChanged<ScopeChange> onChanged;
  …
}
```

On tap, the badge opens a popup menu with three options:
1. **All** — applies immediately, no further action needed
2. **Selected…** — always opens the workspace modal. Current selection is shown
   as a subtitle (e.g. "3 workspaces"). User can add/remove workspaces, then
   "Apply" to confirm.
3. **None** — applies immediately, disables the item everywhere

When scope is already "Selected", tapping the badge reopens the same popup.
This lets the user edit their workspace list at any time without cycling
through other states.

### Badge display

Each item row shows one of:

```
[All ✓]     — green, enabled everywhere
[3 WS ✓]    — green, enabled for 3 named workspaces
[Off]       — grey, disabled
```

The badge text is derived from the current scope state.

### Badge replaces Switch

Each item row currently has a `Switch` widget on the right (for tools: on/off toggle;
for skills/subagents: coming soon). With the scope model, the `Switch` is replaced
by a tappable `TextButton` or `Chip` showing the state badge. Tapping it reveals
the scope picker popup menu. The visual result is cleaner — one interactive element
per row instead of two (switch + scope indicator).

## Agent Loop Integration

When an agent loop is created for workspace W, the backend resolves available
tools/skills/subagents by querying:

```sql
SELECT * FROM item_scopes
WHERE user_id = ?
  AND (
    scope = 'all'
    OR (scope = 'selected' AND workspace_ids CONTAINS ?)
  )
```

Items with `scope=none` or `scope=selected` without W in `workspace_ids`
are excluded from the agent's tool list.

Skills are treated the same way — `SkillRegistry` filters loaded skills
against the `item_scopes` table before injecting them into the agent.

Subagents follow the same pattern — available subagents are filtered by
workspace scope before the coordinator can invoke them.

## Edge Cases

1. **New workspace created**: Items with `scope=all` are automatically available.
   Items with `scope=selected` are not (user must add the workspace explicitly).
   Items with `scope=none` are not available anywhere.

2. **New tool added by SDK update**: Defaults to `scope=all` (opt-out — new
   bundled capabilities are available everywhere until explicitly restricted).

3. **New skill/subagent installed from registry**: Same as SDK tools — defaults
   to `scope=all`. Registry-provided items are treated like bundled capabilities.

4. **Workspace deleted**: References to deleted workspaces in `workspace_ids` are
   cleaned up by the backend on delete. If no workspaces remain, the item
   automatically falls back to `scope=none`.

5. **Workspace renamed**: Uses workspace ID internally, so rename has no effect.

6. **Default state for new user-created items** (skills/subagents created by the
   user): Default to `scope=selected` with the current workspace preselected.
   This is the conservative default — user explicitly expands scope.

7. **Bulk operations**: Future consideration — not in V1. Each item is
   independently configurable.

8. **"Personal" workspace after migration**: Continues to exist for chat
   history, files, and conversations. For tools/skills/subagents, it has no
   special meaning — it's just another workspace in the picker list.

9. **Workspace list for the modal**: The modal's workspace checklist is sourced
    from the existing `GET /workspaces` endpoint (currently used by the sidebar).
    No new endpoint needed.

## Storage Design Notes

- The table is named `item_scopes` to avoid collision with the existing
  `capabilities.yaml` / `capabilities.py` concept. `item_scopes` is about
  per-workspace enable state; `capabilities` is about what features exist.
- If an item has no row in the table, default scoping rules apply (see Edge
  Cases 2, 3, 6). The backend computes the effective scope at query time.
- `workspace_ids` is a JSON array stored as text in SQLite. Queries use
  `json_each()` or equivalent for containment checks.

## Non-Goals

- Bulk enable/disable for multiple items
- Per-item scope for Connectors and Settings (these remain user-level)
- Copy/import scope config between workspaces
- Role-based or team-level scoping (enterprise feature, out of scope)

## Migration Path

1. Add the `item_scopes` table and scope API endpoints
2. Migrate existing per-workspace tool state:
   - If tool is enabled in personal scope AND has no per-workspace overrides →
     `scope=all`
   - If tool has per-workspace state (enabled in one or more specific workspaces)
     → `scope=selected` with the union of all enabled workspace IDs, ignoring
     the personal scope state
   - If tool is not enabled anywhere → `scope=none`
3. Add migration for skills and subagents (currently no per-workspace state —
   all existing items default to `scope=all`)
4. Update `ToolsPanel` → remove ScopeSwitcher, add per-item scope picker
5. Update `SkillsSidebarPanel` → add per-item scope picker
6. Update `SubagentsSidebarPanel` → add per-item scope picker
7. Remove `ScopeSwitcher` widget
