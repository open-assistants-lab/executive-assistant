## 9. Competitive Positioning

EA occupies a unique space: it's the only open-source AI assistant that:
- Ships with built-in tools (email, browser, todos, files), not community plugins
- Learns from conversation over time (Observational Memory + MemoryMiddleware)
- Proactively checks in (Companion System)
- Works with any model (4,172+ via models.dev)
- Runs fully locally with per-user data isolation

No other framework (OpenClaw, Hermes, OpenHUMAN, LangGraph, CrewAI) offers this combination.
