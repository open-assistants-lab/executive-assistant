## 1. Pages

Two dedicated pages following the existing site layout:

| Page | Route | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Privacy Policy | `/privacy` | Australian Privacy Act compliance, data practices disclosure |
| Terms of Service | `/terms` | OSS software terms, liability disclaimer, governing law |

Both pages use `LandingLayout` + `Nav` + `Footer` (same template as `/docs`).
